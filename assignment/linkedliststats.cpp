  // new number if that happens (this is because a uniform
  // distribution goes to +/- infinity). A smart algorithm could in
  // principle take advantage of the higher frequency of access of
  // certain items to lower the average access time. On the other hand,
  // without any "smarts", the mean number of nodes traversed should still
  // be the mean of the distribution, the same as for the uniform distribution.
